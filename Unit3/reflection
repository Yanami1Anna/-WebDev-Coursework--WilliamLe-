Through this unit, I gained valuable experience working with client profiles and conducting interviews. I carefully reviewed Sara, Kai and Shannon's profiles, which helped me understand how to identify different client needs and priorities. During the Ideate phase, I learned to translate client requirements into potential solutions, though I recognize I still need more practice connecting these ideas to actual code implementation.

The interview preparation process taught me the importance of asking the right questions. While I successfully defined client problems and brainstormed solutions, I noticed areas for improvement in my technical execution, particularly in turning client feedback into functional website elements. This showed me that effective web development requires both strong communication skills and technical ability.
