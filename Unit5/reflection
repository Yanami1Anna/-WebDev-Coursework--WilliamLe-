This unit marked my exciting transition into the world of CSS, where I discovered how to bring visual life to HTML structures. In Lesson 1, I learned that CSS is more than just styling - it's a powerful tool for creating responsive, accessible designs. The image sizing challenge helped me understand how CSS controls layout dimensions, which immediately improved my projects' professionalism.

Lesson 2 opened my eyes to typography's importance in web design. Through experimenting with font families and sizes, I saw how text styling directly impacts readability and user experience. The color theory exercises were particularly valuable, teaching me how background and text colors affect accessibility and mood. I now carefully consider contrast ratios in all my designs.

The different styling methods in Lesson 3 revealed CSS's flexibility. I now understand when to use inline styles for quick edits versus external stylesheets for maintainable code. The cascading principle finally made sense as I saw how styles combine and override each other. The internal stylesheet challenge helped me appreciate organized code structure.

Most importantly, this unit taught me that good CSS requires both creativity and systematic thinking. As I continue learning, I'm excited to explore more advanced selectors and layouts to create truly polished websites.
