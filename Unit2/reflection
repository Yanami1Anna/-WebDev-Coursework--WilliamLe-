In this unit explored the fundamentals of design and the iterative Design Thinking process. In Lesson 1, I learned that design is both omnipresent ("Design is all around you!") and methodical, blending creativity with the "science" of website layout, usability, and aesthetics. Lesson 2 framed design as a verb—a problem-solving tool—emphasizing storytelling to connect with users. Key takeaways include recognizing how intentional design shapes user experiences (e.g., intuitive navigation, visual hierarchy) and the value of empathy in the design process.
