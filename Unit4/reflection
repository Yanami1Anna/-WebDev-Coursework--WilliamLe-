In this unit, I've expanded my HTML skills beyond foundational elements to more sophisticated web development techniques. The lessons on HTML attributes were particularly enlightening - I now understand how the title attribute enhances user experience through tooltips, and how the language attribute improves accessibility and SEO. The code challenge helped me practice implementing these attributes effectively.

Working with different list types transformed how I organize content. I can now confidently create ordered lists for step-by-step instructions, unordered lists for item collections, and even nested lists for complex information hierarchies. The description lists introduced me to a new way to present term-definition pairs, which I plan to use in future documentation.

The image embedding section was incredibly practical. I learned the crucial difference between absolute and relative paths, and how proper image sizing impacts page performance. Through the coding exercises, I gained hands-on experience in making visual content responsive.
