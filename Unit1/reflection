This unit introduced the history of the Web (from the 1960s Internet to the 1990s WWW explosion) and core web development concepts. Through Lessons 2-5, I practiced HTML fundamentalsâ€”structure (e.g., <html>, <body>), text formatting (e.g., <h1>, <strong>), and created a basic webpage. Key takeaways include understanding how browsers interpret HTML tags and using developer tools to inspect pages. Challenges included mastering nested tags and semantic HTML (e.g., <article> vs. <section>).
