This unit fundamentally changed how I view web development by connecting technical skills to global impact. Learning about the UN Sustainable Development Goals showed me how websites can serve greater purposes beyond aesthetics and functionality. I was particularly inspired by how digital solutions can address real-world challenges like inequality and climate action.

The code challenge pushed me to create a communication tool that could genuinely serve a community need. This experience taught me that good web design marries technical execution with human-centered thinking. I now consider accessibility, inclusivity and social impact in every project.

Most importantly, this unit helped me see myself not just as a developer, but as a problem-solver who can contribute to meaningful change through technology.
