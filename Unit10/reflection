This unit deepened my understanding of effective website navigation and core design principles. Through hands-on practice, I learned to build functional navigation bars using semantic HTML elements like <nav> and <ul>, style them with CSS hover effects for better interactivity, and ensure accessibility through proper labeling. More importantly, I discovered how navigation ties directly to fundamental design concepts - applying visual hierarchy to guide users, maintaining consistency across pages, leveraging color theory for emotional impact and readability, and selecting typography that enhances content flow. The practical exercises showed me that good navigation isn't just about linking pages, but about creating intuitive pathways that align with overall design goals, balancing aesthetics with usability. These insights have fundamentally changed how I approach structuring and styling website menus.
